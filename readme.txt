This is the database application project for DSE 6100 developed by John Kopchick and Reem Tamimi.

Eclipse, Apache-Tomcat, and MySQL are the necessary software to install, configure and run the application.

Reem managed the github repository, and edited files: user.java and all .jsp. John made the MySQL queries and files: userDAO.java, ControlServlet.java, contest.java, judge.java, and submission.java. We collaborated to develop the ER diagram, and spent a cumulative ~20 hours working together on this project thus far.
