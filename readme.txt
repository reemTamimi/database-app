This is the database application project for DSE 6100 developed by John Kopchick and Reem Tamimi.

Eclipse, Apache-Tomcat, and MySQL are the necessary software to install, configure and run the application.

Reem and John collaborated on all aspects of the project, including managing the github, making class files, updating userDAO and controlServlet, as well as creating the jsp files. We collaborated to develop the ER diagram, and spent a cumulative ~30 hours working together on this project thus far.
